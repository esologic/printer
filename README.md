This repo contains CAD drawings of the shelf I use to store and operate my Prusa i3 MK2s.

The spool holder, the work light and the camera arm all contain printed parts. These available in [./printed-parts-stls](./printed-parts-stls). Their source solidworks files can be found alongside the cad for the rest of the parts on the shelf in [./solidworks](./solidworks).

Origins and design rationale for the work light have been described in [this](https://www.esologic.com/recycling-an-old-friend/) blog post.
